# Java mail server using UDP protocol

- just for learning purpose, this project is building a Java mail server app using UDP protocol, the app doesn't implement a proper database but just a file saving methods

- using flatlaf UI and gson (probably, if Chien implements it :>), so make sure you import two .jar files that i attach with the projects (they are in libraries folder)


### how to run
0. make sure the server and the client is in a same network (same wifi/Lan)
1. run Server -> in src/server folder, run Server.java
2. run Client -> in src/client folder, run Client.java


Have a great day.
