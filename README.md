# Java mail server using UDP protocol

### how to run
0. make sure the server and the client is in a same network (same wifi/Lan)
1. run Server -> in src/server folder, run Server.java
2. run Client -> in src/client folder, run Client.java (note: if you don't know the server's IP and port, check the Server program, i put ServerIP:Port in the title there)
